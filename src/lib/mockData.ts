Chores also help to teach us valuable life skills. Besides that, helping my parents to start off with the household chores is a gracious gesture of love I can show them as they usually come home late in the evening, exhausted from work and long hours of travelling.",
    example: "My parents are pleasantly surprised to come home to a clean and sweet-smelling environment as it is very welcoming to them and their mood is instantly uplifted. I love to see their smiling countenances as it is so rewarding for me. We are very hygiene conscious and feel proud to keep our home spick and span. Cleaning every nook and cranny of our homes will allow us to keep our homes looking presentable and pristine and appear inviting to guests. We learn personal responsibility by keeping our home clean and inviting. Doing household chores imbue us with life-skills like ironing and laundry that would prove valuable when I grow up into an adult and complete my own chores independently.",
